Description: files and utilities common to all X servers
 The X server is the hardware interface of the X Window System.  Its job is to
 communicate with video display and input devices, and present them in a
 standardized, abstract fashion via the X protocol to X clients (X-based
 programs).  The X server largely relieves programs of having to know or care
 about the details of the hardware with which they are interacting (such
 things as 32-bit versus 8-bit color, the layout of the keyboard, how many
 buttons the mouse has, etc.).  The catch is that the X server must itself
 know the technical specifications of the graphics hardware and monitor, the
 keyboard layout, the protocol used by the mouse, and so forth.
 .
 X servers either need fonts installed on the local host, or need to know of a
 remote host that provides font services (with xfs, for instance).  The former
 means that font packages are mandatory.  The latter means that font packages
 may be gratuitous.  To err on the side of caution, install at least the
 xfonts-base, xfonts-100dpi or xfonts-75dpi, and xfonts-scalable packages.

Version: 0.5.2-7

Description: The Debian Almquist Shell
 "dash" is a POSIX compliant shell that is much smaller than "bash".
 We take advantage of that by making it the shell on the installation
 root floppy, where space is at a premium.
 .
 It can be usefully installed as /bin/sh (because it executes scripts
 somewhat faster than "bash"), or as the default shell either of root
 or of a second user with a userid of 0 (because it depends on fewer
 libraries, and is therefore less likely to be affected by an upgrade
 problem or a disk failure).  It is also useful for checking that a
 script uses only POSIX syntax.
 .
 "bash" is a better shell for most users, since it has some nice
 features absent from "dash", and is a required part of the system.

 need to include a makefile snippet and then depend on the
 patch/unpatch target in the build or clean stage of debian/rules - or
 you can use the dpatch patching script directly.

 It can easily apply patches only on specific architectures if needed.

  * Support for several font formats through loadable modules
  * High-quality anti-aliasing
  * High portability & performance
 .
 Supported font formats include:
  * TrueType files (.ttf) and collections (.ttc)
  * Type 1 font files both in ASCII (.pfa) or binary (.pfb) format
  * Type 1 Multiple Master fonts.  The FreeType 2 API also provides
    routines to manage design instances easily
  * Type 1 CID-keyed fonts
  * OpenType/CFF (.otf) fonts
  * CFF/Type 2 fonts
  * Adobe CEF fonts (.cef), used to embed fonts in SVG documents with
    the Adobe SVG viewer plugin.
  * Windows FNT/FON bitmap fonts

Description: Perl module for parsing XML files
 This module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on top
 of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James
 Clark's expat library.  Each call to one of the parsing methods
 creates a new instance of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to
 parse the document.  Expat options may be provided when the
 XML::Parser object is created.  These options are then passed on to
 the Expat object on each parse call.  They can also be given as extra
 arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options
 given at XML::Parser creation time.
 .
 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or
 Handlers options, or by setHandlers method.  These all provide
 mechanisms for XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by
 XML::Parser::Expat.  If neither Style nor Handlers are specified,
 then parsing just checks the document for being well-formed.
 .
 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first
 parameter the Expat object, not the Parser object.

 libraries in the client and link against Xmuu instead of Xmu, Xt, and Xaw.
 Needless to say, if the client uses functions from Xmu, Xt, or Xaw that are
 not present in Xmuu, it will fail to link.

Description: Update Configuration File: preserves user changes to config files.
 Debian policy states that configuration files must preserve user
 changes during package upgrade.  The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a `conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it.  This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile like handling for files that
 can not be labelled conffiles, are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead.  This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for "conffiles".
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided conffile like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 install time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Description: miscellaneous X clients
 An X client is a program that interfaces with an X server (almost always via
 the X libraries), and thus with some input and output hardware like a
 graphics card, monitor, keyboard, and pointing device (such as a mouse).
 .
 This package provides a miscellaneous assortment of several dozen X clients
 that ship with the X Window System, including:
  - startx and xinit, which initialize X sessions from the command line;
  - xauth, a tool for controlling access to the X session;
  - xedit, a text editor;
  - xbiff, a tool which tells you when you have new email;
  - xcalc, a scientific calculator desktop accessory;
  - xclipboard, a tool to manage cut-and-pasted text selections;
  - xcutsel, which exchanges selection and cut buffer contents;
  - xconsole, which monitors system console messages;
  - xditview, a viewer for ditroff output;
  - xeyes, a demo program in which a pair of eyes track the pointer;
  - xfd, a tool that displays all the glyphs in a given X font;
  - xfontsel, a tool for browsing and selecting X fonts;
  - xhost, a very dangerous program that you should never use;
  - xkill, a tool for terminating misbehaving X clients;
  - xload, a monitor for the system load average;
  - xlogo, a demo program that displays the X logo;
  - xmag, which magnifies parts of the X screen;
  - xman, a manual page browser;
  - xmessage, a tool to display message or dialog boxes;
  - xrandr, a command-line interface to the RandR extension;
  - xrefresh, a tool that forces a redraw of the X screen;
  - xsetroot, a tool for tailoring the appearance of the root window;
  - xtrapchar, xtrapin, xtrapinfo, xtrapout, xtrapproto, xtrapreset, and
    xtrapstats, a group of sample clients that use the XTrap extension;
  - xvidtune, a tool for customizing X server modelines for your monitor;
  - xwd, a utility for taking window dumps ("screenshots") of the X session;
  - xwud, a viewer for window dumps created by xwd;
  - oclock and xclock, graphical clocks;
  - beforelight, a screen saver;
  - atobm, a converter from ASCII to X bitmap (.xbm) files;
  - bitmap, a monochrome bitmap file editor;
  - bmtoa, a tool that converts a monochrome bitmap to ASCII text;
  - cxpm and sxpm, tools for checking and viewing X pixmap files;
  - dpsexec, a Display PostScript program that allows the user to interact
    directly with the PostScript interpreter through a command interface
  - dpsinfo, a utility for displaying information about the DPS extension
    present in an X server or provided by a client-side DPS agent
  - glxgears, a GLX demo that draws three rotating gears, and prints
    framerate information to standard output
  - iceauth, a tool for manipulating ICE protocol authorization records;
  - texteroids, a spinning text demo for the DPS extension
  - xset, a tool for setting miscellaneous X server parameters;
  - xmodmap, a utility for modifying keymaps and pointer button mappings in X;
  - xsetmode and xsetpointer, tools for handling X Input devices;
  - setxkbmap, xkbbell, xkbcomp, xkbevd, xkbprint, xkbvleds, and xkbwatch,
    tools for managing the X Keyboard Extension (XKB);
  - xsm, a session manager for X sessions;
  - smproxy, a session manager proxy for X clients that do not use the X
    session manager protocol;
  - xgamma, a tool for querying and setting a monitor's gamma correction;
  - appres, editres, listres, viewres, and xrdb, which query and update the
    X resource database;
  - Xmark, x11perf, and x11perfcomp, tools for benchmarking graphical
    operations under the X Window System;
  - fstobdf, which retrieves a font in BDF format from an X font server;
  - xcmsdb, a device color characteristic utility for the X Color Management
    System;
  - xstdcmap, a utility to selectively define standard colormap properties;
  - xev, an X event displayer;
  - xfindproxy, a tool to locate X proxy services;
  - xlsatoms, which lists interned atoms defined on an X server;
  - xlsclients, which lists client applications running on an X display;
  - xlsfonts, a server font list displayer;
  - xprop, a property displayer for X;
  - xdpyinfo, a display information utility for X;
  - xwininfo, a window information utility for X;
  - glxinfo, a GLX extension information utility for X;
  - xvinfo, an Xv extension information utility for X;
  - ico, an X graphics demo using an animated polyhedron;
  - dga, a demo program for the DGA extension; and
  - xgc, an (unfinished) X graphics demo program.
 .
 xbase-clients also -- except on the s390 architecture -- contains the X.Org
 X server configuration programs xorgcfg and xorgconfig, but in general the
 Debconf interface to the xserver-xorg package should be used instead of
 these tools.
 .
 The bitmap, editres, viewres, xbiff, xcalc, xconsole, xditview, xedit,
 xf86cfg, xman, xsetroot, and xsm programs use bitmap images provided by the
 xlibs-data package.  xkbcomp uses the XKEYBOARD (XKB) extension configuration
 data provided by the xlibs package.
 .
 xrdb requires the C preprocessor (cpp) to process X resource files.  The GNU
 C preprocessor's "-traditional" support misbehaves in early releases of the
 GCC 3.3 series; therefore, this package conflicts with those versions.
 .
 (Strictly speaking, atobm does not depend on any X libraries, but it shares a
 manual page with bitmap and bmtoa, and so is grouped with them in this
 package.)
 .
 This package no longer provides the 'mkfontscale' program; it has instead been
 moved to xutils.

 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: the xine video player, user interface
 This is an X11 based GUI for the libxine video player library.
 It provides xine, a skin based media player that can play all the
 audio/video formats that libxine supports. Currently, this includes MPEG1/2,
 some AVI and Quicktime files, some network streaming methods and disc based
 media (VCD, SVCD, DVD). A more complete list can be found on
 http://xinehq.de/index.php/features/.
 .
 This package contains an additional front end, aaxine, which runs even on the
 console. aaxine uses aalib to render ASCII art video, or you can tell it to
 use a framebuffer device. This is more a proof of concept, but you can use it
 to watch DVDs on your old vt100 terminal, of course. ;-)
 .
 Most DVDs on the market today are play-protected by the Content Scrambling
 System (CSS). Xine does not provide any code to descramble those DVDs,
 because of legal uncertainties. Have a look at
 /usr/share/doc/xine-ui/README.Debian for more information!

 Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
 on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is
 needed. however, most of the work on Pango-1.0 was done using the GTK+
 widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text and
 font handling for GTK+-2.0.
 .
 Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used with
 four different font backends:
  - Core X windowing system fonts
  - Client-side fonts on X using the Xft library
  - Direct rendering of scalable fonts using the FreeType library
  - Native fonts on Microsoft backends
 .
 This package contains the header files and some files needed for development
 with Pango.

Description: ALSA wrapper for OSS applications
 This package contains a program loader, aoss, which wraps
 applications written for OSS in a compatibility library,
 thus allowing them to work with ALSA.
 .
 There are two ways of getting an application to work with
 ALSA if the application was written for OSS. The first way
 is to load the special ALSA drivers that emulate the OSS
 kernel interface; these allow the application to open
 /dev/dsp0 and other OSS device files. The second way is
 to wrap the application in the libaoss library provided
 in this package; the wrapper causes the application to
 access native ALSA device files such as /dev/snd/pcmC0D0c
 instead of OSS device files.
 .
 Use of the alsa-oss library is recommended over the use of
 OSS-emulation drivers if you want to use ALSA's PCM plugin
 layer.
 .
 ALSA is the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture:

Description: light-weight text editor
 gedit is a text editor which supports most standard editor features,
 extending this basic functionality with other features not usually
 found in simple text editors. gedit is a graphical application which
 supports editing multiple text files in one window (known sometimes as
 tabs or MDI).
 .
 gedit fully supports international text through its use of the Unicode
 UTF-8 encoding in edited files. Its core feature set includes syntax
 highlighting of source code, auto indentation and printing and print preview
 support.
 .
 gedit is also extensible through its plugin system, which currently
 includes support for spell checking, comparing files, viewing CVS
 ChangeLogs, and adjusting indentation levels.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system
 D-BUS is a message bus, used for sending messages between
 applications.  Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets
 and CORBA in terms of complexity.
 .
 D-BUS supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more.  It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML.  D-BUS also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 D-BUS is still under heavy development, but is expected to be widely
 used.  It comes with several interfaces, including GLib.  See the
 description of dbus-glib-1 for more information about those.

Description: X terminal emulator
 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.
 .
 This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional
 terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is
 intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8
 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the xutils
 package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the
 KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the
 previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings.
 .
 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator
 is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.
 .
 The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xlibs-data package.
 .
 Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the
 xfonts-cyrillic package as well.

Description: Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software,generic shared
 ATLAS is an approach for the automatic generation and optimization of
 numerical software. Currently ATLAS supplies optimized versions for the
 complete set of linear algebra kernels known as the Basic Linear Algebra
 Subroutines (BLAS), and a subset of the linear algebra routines in the
 LAPACK library.
 .
 The libraries in this package are built without any processor extension
 instructions, and should run on all processors of this general
 architecture, albeit less than optimally.
 .
 On some architectures, multiple binary packages are provided to take
 advantage of certain commonly available processor instruction set
 extensions.  The instruction extension set used is indicated in the
 package name, with 'base' denoting no extensions. In general, you
 will obtain the best performance by installing the package with the
 most advanced instruction extension set your machine is capable of
 running.

 o Adduser can create new users and groups and add existing users to
   existing groups.
 o Deluser can remove users and groups and remove users from a given
   group.
 .
 Adding users with adduser is much easier than adding them by hand.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, allow you to set an
 initial password and the GECOS field.
 .
 Deluser can optionally remove and backup the user's home directory
 and mail spool or all files on the system owned by him.
 .
 Optionally a custom script can be executed after each of the commands.
 .
 Adduser is maintained on http://alioth.debian.org/projects/adduser/.
 There is also a development mailing list on
 http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/adduser-devel/.

Description: standard fonts for X
 xfonts-base provides a standard set of low-resolution bitmapped fonts.  In
 most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server
 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package contains primarily fonts in the ISO 10646-1 and ISO 8859-1
 encodings, to conserve disk space.  (A small selection of fonts in ISO
 8859-8, JIS-X0208.1983, JIS-X0208.1976, and GB2312.1980 fonts are also
 included.)  For other encodings, see the xfonts-base-transcoded package.
 .
 If you are not using a remote font server, you must install this package if
 you are installing an X server.  It contains fonts without which X servers
 will not work.
 .
 This package also provides a set of files that can be used by the X or
 fonts server to transcode fonts from one encoding to another (e.g., KOI8-R
 to ISO-8859-5).
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories
 for use by an X server or X font server.

 flavor is included in Debian as the "gs-gpl" package.
 .
 ESP Ghostscript: Free software released under the GNU GPL. This
 version of Ghostscript is maintained and enhanced by Easy Software
 Products et. al., and supposed to be well-suited to the CUPS.  This
 flavor is included in Debian as the "gs-esp" package.
 .
 AFPL Ghostscript: This flavour is the more current and more up to
 date one but under a license that is not DFSG-free. If you want to
 use this package please make sure that you agree to the license. The
 AFPL variant of Ghostscript is not part of the official Debian
 distribution but we provide a package for it in the non-free section
 as a service to our users.  This flavor is called the "gs-afpl"
 package.
 .
 This package contains the common files among these flavors for
 managing the font installation and some wrapper scripts.

 Since almost every system vendor provides a different interface for
 packet capture, and since there are several tools that require this
 functionality, we've created this system-independent API to ease in
 porting and to alleviate the need for several system-dependent packet
 capture modules in each application.

Description: Terminal emulator widget for GTK+ 2.0 - common files
 The VTE library inserts terminal capability strings into a trie, and then
 uses it to determine if data received from a pseudo-terminal is a control
 sequence or just random data. The sample program "interpret" illustrates
 more or less what the widget sees after it filters incoming data.
 .

Description: multi-protocol instant messaging client
 Gaim is a modular Instant Messaging client capable of using AIM, ICQ,
 Yahoo!, MSN, IRC, Jabber, Napster, Zephyr, and Gadu-Gadu all at once.
 It is written using GTK+ and is licensed under the GPL.
 .
 As the name suggests, it was originally designed for using AOL's
 Instant Messenger service (you can sign up at http://www.aim.aol.com/).
 Consequently it contains many of the same features as AOL's IM client,
 as well as incorporating many new and unique features, such as the
 multiple protocol support.
 .
 Gaim used to ship a gaim-gnome package which contained an applet for
 the GNOME 1.4 panel. This has been replaced in favor of a tray
 icon plugin, contained in this version. To see it in GNOME 2, use
 the Notification Area applet (included in gnome-panel versions 2.1 and
 later), or in KDE 3.1 it should appear in the Kicker's system tray.
 Users of other window managers should investigate docker, the WM dock
 app.

Description: a 3D first person tank battle game
 BZFlag is a 3D multi-player multiplatform tank battle game
 that allows users to play against each other in a network
 environment. There are five teams: red, green, blue,
 purple and rogue (rogue tanks are black).  Destroying a
 player on another team scores a win, while being destroyed
 or destroying a teammate scores a loss. Rogues have no
 teammates (not even other rogues), so they cannot shoot
 teammates and they do not have a team score.
 .
 There are two main styles of play: capture-the-flag and
 free-for-all. In capture-the-flag, each team (except
 rogues) has a team base and each team with at least one
 player has a team flag. The object is to capture an enemy
 team's flag by bringing it to your team's base. This
 destroys every player on the captured team, subtracts one
 from that team's score, and adds one to your team's score.
 In free-for-all, there are no team flags or team bases.
 The object is simply to get as high a score as possible.

Description: 100 dpi fonts for X
 xfonts-100dpi provides a set of bitmapped fonts at 100 dots per inch.  In
 most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server
 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package contains only fonts in the ISO 10646-1 and ISO 8859-1
 encodings, to conserve disk space.  For other encodings, see the
 xfonts-100dpi-transcoded package.
 .
 This package and xfonts-75dpi provide the same set of fonts, rendered at
 different resolutions; only one or the other is necessary, but both may be
 installed.  xfonts-100dpi may be more suitable for large monitors and/or
 large screen resolutions (over 1024x768).
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories for
 use by an X server or X font server.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the Web
 using http and ftp, the two most widely used Internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as ftp
 sites -- you can use wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both http and ftp) that support it. Both http and ftp
 retrievals can be time stamped, so wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: Circumvent Debian package dependencies
 This package provides a tool to create Debian
 packages that only contain dependency information.
 .
 If a package P is not installed on the system, packages
 that depend on P cannot normally be installed.  However,
 if equivalent functionality to P is known to be installed,
 this tool can be used to trick the Debian package management
 system into believing that package P is actually installed.
 .
 Another possibility is creation of a meta package. When this
 package contains a dependency as "Depends: a, b, c", then
 installing this package will also select packages a, b and c.
 Instead of "Depends", you can also use "Recommends:" or
 "Suggests:" for less demanding dependency.
 .
 Please note that this is a crude hack and if thoughtlessly used,
 it might possibly do damage to your packaging system. And please
 note as well that using it is not the recommended way of dealing
 with broken dependencies. Better file a bug report instead.

Size: 78630
Description: a pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and
 processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. Mawk
 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: X Window System (X.Org) infrastructure
 x11-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further
 installation of the X Window System in any configuration.
 .
 Those wishing an X server only (with remote font services and clients) will
 also require the xserver-common package and an X server package (most
 likely xserver-xorg).
 .
 The counterpart to the above configuration is a machine with the X libraries
 (the xlibs package), xbase-clients, a window manager, some X font packages,
 and likely many more client packages.
 .
 Those who desire a standalone X workstation (and/or are fuzzy on the concepts
 of X servers and X clients) will require both of the above sets of packages.
 For convenience, the "x-window-system" metapackage will include everything
 that is required for a standalone X workstation.
 .
 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X", "X
 Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R6.8".  The version of X used in Debian
 is derived from the version released by the X.Org Foundation, and is thus
 often also referred to as "X.Org".  All of the preceding quoted terms are
 functionally interchangeable in an Debian system.
 .
 Until recently, Debian shipped an X implementation released by The XFree86
 Project, Inc. (aka "XFree86").  The X.Org implementation is derived from the
 XFree86 implementation previously shipped, and is generally considered to be
 the standard implementation by vendors and distributors.

Size: 170348
Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

 DocBook is an XML document type definition (DTD).  That is, it
 contains the "DocBook" document structure.  This is used by authors
 or editors writing documents in the DocBook XML format.  DocBook was
 designed for books, articles, or reference documentation about
 technical matters or software.  It has emerged as an open, standard
 DTD in the software industry, and is the documentation system of
 choice for many free software projects.
 .
 This package contains the XML DTD for DocBook, which describes the
 formal structure for documents following this format.  If you wish to
 author DocBook documents using SGML rather than XML, use the
 'docbook' package.  You will need other packages in order to edit
 (psgml), validate (opensp, libxml2) or format (docbook-xsl,
 docbook-dsssl) DocBook documents.
 .
 This package ships with the latest DocBook XML DTD, as well as a
 select set of legacy DTDs for use with older documents.

Size: 733200
Description: X Window System protocol client library
 The libX11 library, also known as "Xlib", provides a means of communicating
 with an X server via the X protocol.
 .
 Xlib provides low-level functionality, dealing mostly with the wire protocol
 and in terms of basic operations such as opening and closing the connection
 to the X server, creating graphics contexts, drawing graphics primitives such
 as lines, arcs, and glyphs, handling events, and so forth.  A set of
 dynamically-loadable internationalization modules is also part of this
 package, though not in the libX11 shared object itself.
 .
 Application programmers who are new to the X Window System will likely find
 one of the many "Toolkit" libraries far more convenient to program against
 than Xlib directly.  Examples of popular toolkit libraries are GTK+, Qt,
 XForms, LessTif, and Athena.
 .
 libx11-6 depends on xlibs-data for locale data and the X error and keysym
 databases.

    o A CSSOM like api. CSSOM stands for Cascading Style Sheet Object Model.
 .
    The libcroco parser implements the CSS Level 2 specification, the CSS
    forward compatibility rules and the CSS cascading rules.
 .
  * A CSS2 selection engine
    Given an xml element node (that obviously comes from an xml document) and
    a stylesheet cascade, the Libcroco selection engine can evaluate the css
    selectors of the cascade and return the style properties associated to
    the xml element node.
 .
    Note that the xml manipulation toolkit used by the libcroco selection
    engine at the moment is libxml2.

Description: rich set of graph drawing tools
 Graph drawing addresses the problem of visualizing structural information
 by constructing geometric representations of abstract graphs and networks.
 Automatic generation of graph drawings has important applications in key
 technologies such as database design, software engineering, VLSI and
 network design and visual interfaces in other domains. Situations where
 these tools might be particularly useful include:
 .
   * you would like to restructure a program and first need to understand
     the relationships between its types, procedures, and source files.
   * you need to find the bottlenecks in an Internet backbone - not only
     individual links, but their relationships
   * you're debugging a protocol or microarchitecture represented as a
     finite state machine and need to figure out how a certain
     error state arises
   * you would like to browse a database schema, knowledge base, or
     distributed program represented pictorially
   * you would like to see an overview of a collection of linked documents
   * you would like to discover patterns and communities of interest in a
     database of telephone calls or e-mail messages
 .

Description: X Window System utility programs
 xutils provides a set of utility programs shipped with the X Window System
 that do not require the X libraries; many of these programs are useful
 even on a system that does not have any X clients or X servers installed.
 .
 The programs in this package include:
  - bdftopcf, which converts BDF fonts to PCF fonts;
  - bdftruncate and ucs2any, tools to generate fonts with various encodings
    from ISO 10646-encoded fonts
  - ccmakedep, a version of makedepend which "does it right"
  - cleanlinks, a program to remove dangling symlinks and empty directories
    from a shadow link tree (created with lndir)
  - fslsfonts, a tool that lists fonts served by an X font server;
  - imake, a C preprocessor interface to the make utility;
  - lndir, a tool that creates a shadow directory of symbolic links to
    another directory tree;
  - luit, a filter that can be run between an arbitrary application and a
    UTF-8 terminal emulator;
  - makedepend, a tool to create dependencies in makefiles;
  - makeg, a tool for making debuggable executables;
  - makepsres, a tool that creates PostScript language resource database
    files;
  - makestrs, a tool that makes string table C source and header(s);
  - mkcfm, a tool that create summaries of font metric files in CID font
    directories;
  - mkdirhier, a tool that creates a directory hierarchy;
  - mkfontdir, a program to generate fonts.dir files;
  - scanpci, a utility for retrieving information about the PCI bus and
    devices on it (not available on all architectures);
  - pcitweak, a utility that can be used to examine or change registers in
    the PCI configuration space (not available on all architectures);
  - pswrap, a tool that creates C procedures from segments of PostScript
    language code;
  - resize, which prints a shell command for setting the TERM and TERMCAP
    environment variables to indicate the current size of the xterm (or
    compatible program) window from which the command is run;
  - revpath, which generates a relative path that can be used to undo a
    change-directory;
  - rstart, a remote start client;
  - rstartd, a remote start daemon activated by rstart connections;
  - sessreg, a simple program for managing utmp/wtmp entries;
  - showfont, a font dumper for use with an X font server;
  - showrgb, a decompiler for RGB color-name databases;
  - xfsinfo, an X font server information utility;
  - xmkmf, a tool that creates a Makefile from an Imakefile; and
  - xon, a tool that starts an X program on a remote machine.
 .
 Installation of an rsh or ssh daemon (server) is necessary if rstartd is
 to be used, and installation of an rsh or ssh client is necessary if
 rstart is to be used.  The luit program requires locale information from
 the xlibs-data package.
 .
 imake uses the C preprocessor (cpp) as a macro processor.  The GNU C
 preprocessor's "-traditional" support misbehaves in early releases of the GCC
 3.3 series; therefore, this package conflicts with those versions.

Size: 96332
Description: Open Crypto Development Kit (OpenCDK) (runtime)
 This library provides functions to handle basic parts of the OpenPGP
 message format.
 .
 The aim of the library is *not* to replace any available PGP version.
 There will be no real support for key management (sign, revoke, alter
 preferences, ...) and some other parts are only rudimentarily
 available. The main purpose is to handle and understand OpenPGP
 packets and to execute basic operations on them. For example to
 encrypt/decrypt or to sign/verify keys and some packet routines.
 .
 Because of the fact that sensitive data is being handled, the
 library doesn't contain any real cryptographic code. The libgcrypt
 package is used for all crypto routines.
 .
 This package contains the runtime library for OpenCDK.

 The diff package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: high-quality block-sorting file compressor library - runtime
 This package contains libbzip2 which is used by the bzip2 compressor.
 .
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: management of regular background processing
 cron is a background process (`daemon') that runs programs at regular
 intervals (for example, every minute, day, week or month); which
 processes are run and at what times are specified in the `crontab'.
 .
 Users may also install crontabs so that processes are run on
 their behalf, though this feature can be disabled or restricted to
 particular users.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package is configured by default to do various standard
 system maintenance tasks, such as ensuring that logfiles do not
 grow endlessly and overflow the disk.
 .
 The lockfile-progs package is only a "Suggests" because of the poor
 way that dselect handles "Recommends", but I do strongly suggest that
 you install it; it prevents /etc/cron.daily/standard from running multiple
 times if something gets jammed.

Description: Authentication abstraction library
 SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for
 adding authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use
 SASL, a protocol includes a command for identifying and
 authenticating a user to a server and for optionally negotiating
 protection of subsequent protocol interactions. If its use is
 negotiated, a security layer is inserted between the protocol and the
 connection. See RFC 2222 for more information.
 .
 This is the Cyrus SASL API implementation, version 2.
 .
 Any of: ANONYMOUS, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, GSSAPI (MIT Kerberos 5 or Heimdal
 Kerberos 5), KERBEROS_V4, OTP, PLAIN, or LOGIN can be used. This package
 is unusable without the SASL plugins. Most likely you will need to install

 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.

 System calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel
 interface. A close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug
 isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.

 Less is a program similar to more(1), but which allows backward
 movement in the file as well as forward movement.  Also, less does not
 have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input
 files it starts up faster than text editors like vi(1).  Less uses
 termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a variety of
 terminals.  There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals.

Description: Open Crypto Development Kit (OpenCDK) (development files)
 This library provides functions to handle basic parts of the OpenPGP
 message format.
 .
 The aim of the library is *not* to replace any available PGP version.
 There will be no real support for key management (sign, revoke, alter
 preferences, ...) and some other parts are only rudimentarily
 available. The main purpose is to handle and understand OpenPGP
 packets and to execute basic operations on them. For example to
 encrypt/decrypt or to sign/verify keys and some packet routines.
 .
 Because of the fact that sensitive data is being handled, the
 library doesn't contain any real cryptographic code. The libgcrypt
 package is used for all crypto routines.
 .
 This package contains the development files: headers and static
 library.
